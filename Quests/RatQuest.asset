  description: Eh, so you're reliable? Ever since people left the area I've been
    having a rat infestation, particularly around the other homestead. Try eliminating
    a few of the rats.
  completed: Well met. With your help I was able to get some extra work done. Plus,
    it's nice to not have rats running around that home. Who knows? Maybe someone
    will move into that place one day.
