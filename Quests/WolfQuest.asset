  description: There are wolves around the bend that have been burdening my exploration
    efforts. They're bound to run from you rather than attack, but we can't risk
    having them around. Please handle the situation and report back.
  completed: Great! With the wolves removed I can now move freely about. Give me
    a moment and I'll see if I can work on having the boulders that are northeast
    of the lone homestead removed.
